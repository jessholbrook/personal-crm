# Personal CRM

## Project Overview
Personal CRM for managing relationships, interactions, and follow-ups.

## Tech Stack
TBD — use `/workflows:brainstorm` to decide.

## Directory Structure
- `docs/solutions/` — Compound docs (created by `/workflows:compound`)
- `docs/plans/` — Implementation plans (created by `/workflows:plan`)
- `docs/brainstorms/` — Exploration docs (created by `/workflows:brainstorm`)
- `tasks/todo.md` — Current tasks
- `tasks/lessons.md` — Accumulated lessons

## Workflow
Use the compound engineering loop:
1. `/workflows:brainstorm` for new ideas
2. `/workflows:plan` for implementation specs
3. `/workflows:work` to execute
4. `/workflows:review` for multi-agent review
5. `/workflows:compound` to document learnings

## Conventions
(Populated via taste extraction as we work.)

## Testing
- Write tests before or alongside implementation
- Use Context7 MCP for up-to-date framework docs
